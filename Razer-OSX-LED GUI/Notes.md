#  Notes

## TO DO:
* Add contraints to views

### BUGS:
* Color pickers not always show up. Is there a way to integrate them in the view?
* Dismissing 'About' view without clicking on 'Back' leaves the app in an undetermined state, with no way to quit.
* Driver not always responds correctly; this isn't handled at all. Should retry?

### Nice to haves:
* Some kind of error management?
* Check selected things to see if they form a compatible combination for command.
